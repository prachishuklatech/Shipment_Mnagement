Shipment Management Form

 Description
The Shipment Management Form is a web-based application that allows users to store and manage shipment details using JsonPowerDB (JPDB). This form enables users to input shipment information, including shipment number, description, source, destination, shipping date, and expected delivery date. The data is securely stored in a JSON-based database, ensuring easy retrieval and management.

 Benefits of Using JsonPowerDB
- Simple JSON-based storage: No need for complex SQL queries, making it easy to integrate.
- High performance: Fast and efficient data retrieval and storage.
- Schema-free: Allows flexible data handling without predefined table structures.
- Lightweight and serverless: Ideal for small projects and applications without heavy backend requirements.
- Easy API integration: Directly interacts with the database using simple REST API calls.

 Release History
- Version 1.0 (Initial Release):
  - Implemented the shipment management form with form validation.
  - Integrated JSONPowerDB with API calls.
  - Added functionality to save shipment details to the database.
  - Implemented form reset after submission.
